      <h2>5G Benefits That Will Change the World</h2>
      <h5>Published on Jan 03, 2020 by Shinde Pallavi</h5>

      <p>A: 5G is driving global growth.<br><br>

        • $13.1 Trillion dollars of global economic output<br>
        • $22.8 Million new jobs created<br>
        • $265B global 5G CAPEX and R&D annually over the next 15 years<br><br>
        
        Through a landmark 5G Economy study, we found that 5G’s full economic effect will likely be realized across the globe
         by 2035—supporting a wide range of industries and potentially enabling up to $13.1 trillion worth of goods and services.<br><br>
        
        This impact is much greater than previous network generations. The development requirements
         of the new 5G network are also expanding beyond the traditional mobile networking players to industries such as the automotive industry.<br><br>
        
        The study also revealed that the 5G value chain (including OEMs, operators, content creators, app developers, and consumers) could alone support up to 22.8 million jobs, or more than one job for every person in Beijing, China. And there are many emerging and new 
        applications that will still be defined in the future. Only time will tell what the full “5G effect” on the economy is going to be.</p>

      <h2>differences between the previous generations of mobile networks and 5G?</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:150px;"><img src="img/img2.png"></div>
      <p>The previous generations of mobile networks are 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G.<br><br>

        First generation - 1G<br>
        1980s: 1G delivered analog voice.<br><br>
        
        Second generation - 2G<br>
        Early 1990s: 2G introduced digital voice (e.g. CDMA- Code Division Multiple Access).<br><br>
        
        Third generation - 3G<br>
        Early 2000s: 3G brought mobile data (e.g. CDMA2000).<br><br>
        
        Fourth generation - 4G LTE<br>
        2010s: 4G LTE ushered in the era of mobile broadband.<br><br>
        
        1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G all led to 5G, which is designed to provide more connectivity than was ever available before.
        
        5G is a unified, more capable air interface. It has been designed with an extended capacity to enable next-generation user experiences, empower new deployment models and deliver new service.<br><br>
        With high speeds, superior reliability and negligible latency, 5G will expand the mobile ecosystem into new realms. 5G will impact every industry, making safer transportation, remote healthcare, precision agriculture, digitized logistics — and more — a reality.</p>

      <h2>How fast is 5G?</h2>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:100px;"><img height= 120 src="img/img3.png"></div>
      <p>A: 5G is designed to deliver peak data rates up to 20 Gbps based on IMT-2020 requirements. Qualcomm Technologies’ flagship 5G solutions, the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ X65 is designed to achieve up to 10 Gbps in downlink peak data rates.<br><br>

        But 5G is about more than just how fast it is. In addition to higher peak data rates, 5G is designed to provide much more network capacity by expanding into new spectrum, such as mmWave.<br><br>
        
        5G can also deliver much lower latency for a more immediate response and can provide an overall more uniform user experience so that the data rates stay consistently high—even when users are moving around. 
        And the new 5G NR mobile network is backed up by a Gigabit LTE coverage foundation, which can provide ubiquitous Gigabit-class connectivity.<br><br></p>
